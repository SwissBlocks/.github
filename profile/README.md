SwissBlocks is an institutional-grade Layer 2 settlement platform built on the Solana blockchain. 

Our mission is to architect the open, standardized, and secure foundation for the future of finance, providing the core infrastructure for financial institutions to operate in the tokenized economy. 

We enable banks, asset managers, and other financial players to securely issue, manage, and settle digital assets on-chain.

In development is the Open Token Standard. This standard will provide a universal framework for tokenizing real-world and digital assets, ensuring interoperability, security, and regulatory compliance across the entire ecosystem.
